# vyqda tasks
Hello,The tasks have been completed. Since the requirements were not clearly defined, I applied some flexibility in interpreting them to ensure the tasks were well-structured. This allowed me to progress with the layout while keeping it aligned with the overall project objectives.Here’s my understanding of the tasks:Task 1
The requirement was to create a spreadsheet-like page where data is displayed in rows, with each cell editable. Any changes should be updated in the backend via an API call if available.Task 2
A to-do list application was needed, allowing users to add, delete, and view tasks, with updates stored in a MySQL database. The arrangement of tasks on the grid was unclear, so I designed it to align with standard conventions. Additionally, since the content and heading fields weren’t specified in the display, I added them along with a button for usability.Task 3
I developed a React app where users can input a phone number and click a button. Since it wasn’t clear which specific field from the headers was required, I displayed both the headers and data after the button is clicked.The deployed links for each task are as follows:
